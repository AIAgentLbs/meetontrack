# MeetOnTrack website ownership

Owner scope decision: 2026-10-19.

This existing GitHub Pages repository owns the public MeetOnTrack website,
domain/DNS launch work, analytics, SEO, competitor comparisons, keyword and
trademark research, and promotional material. Use root `SITE_TODO.md` as the
single task tracker for those concerns.

Application implementation and end-user runtime acceptance belong to
`AIAgentLbs/meeting-copilot-private-copy` and its `docs/TODO.md`. Older application
files and records in this public checkout are not a reason to maintain a second
active application backlog. Preserve them until a reviewed migration; release
hosting and website download links must keep working.

Inspect branch/status and current canonical website revision before publishing.
This local checkout contains unrelated dirty application work and diverged
history; do not reset, overwrite, or deploy it wholesale. This scope decision is
not permission to alter DNS/accounts or publish unreviewed files.

Secrets stay in the approved Vault; private operational evidence stays in
`AIAgentLbs/operations`. Keep only a reference here, not private account records
or a duplicated operational backlog.
