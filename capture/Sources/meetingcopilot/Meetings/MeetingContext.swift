/// what the calendar calls it, who else is invited, and which app is holding
/// the microphone.
///
/// It exists to answer the question you actually have three weeks later, which
/// is never "what happened at 20:39" but "where's that call with the client".
/// So the folder gets a name — `2026.08.17-2039 Integration sync (zoom.us)` —
/// and meta.json gets the rest, including the attendee list, which then goes
/// into the summarizer's prompt where knowing the participants measurably
/// improves what comes back.
///
/// Everything here is optional. A manual recording with no calendar entry and
/// no recognizable app is still a perfectly good recording; it just gets a
/// folder named after the time, exactly as before.
